<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Freak Diving.Com is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the
Andaman South who meet up for diving trips in the summer
months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are
flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the
costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that everyone
gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
<p>Although we're based in the Andaman South, we don't stay on our
own turf: past diving weekends away have included trips up to
Scapa Flow in North Bay, Havelock and to Neil Islands numerous wreck
sites.</p>
<p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub
to talk about our recent adventures (any excuse, eh?).</p>
